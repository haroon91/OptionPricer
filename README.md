****** Installation Instructions ****** 

This program is built on Python version 2.7. In order to run this
program you would need to install the **pygubu** package first. If you have
pip installed you can simply call 'pip install pygubu' in the command prompt.

****** TIP on UI navigation ****** 

Each button on the main window will open an additional window to let you calculate
the option price. If you closed this additional window you would have to run the program again.
So it it recommended that for multiple option calculation just navigate to the main window
and open a new option window.

For Monte Carlo simulation, the UI might become unresponsive while calculating option price.
This is normal. Please be patient and don't close the window.
